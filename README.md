# HTP — Real-Life RPG System

**A universal framework that turns real-world behavior into RPG-style stats, levels, and progression using AI sensing + psychology.**

---

## 🧠 Core Principle

> **Humans don’t crave results. They crave visible progress.**

This system uses **AI + wearables + behavioral science** to convert micro-changes in real life into RPG-style feedback loops — creating sustainable motivation through visible progression.

## 🧩 System Architecture

### 1. Reality Input Layer (Sensors)

AI reads real-world signals:

- **Movement** (steps, posture, reaction speed)  
- **Physiology** (heart rate, recovery, sleep, stress)  
- **Cognition** (focus duration, habit consistency)  
- **Emotion** (pattern-based inference)

→ These become raw **RPG inputs**.

---

### 2. Stat Translation Layer

Inputs are mapped to symbolic stats (non-medical):

| Stat | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **STR** | Output force patterns |
| **AGI** | Reaction + coordination |
| **END** | Recovery rate |
| **INT** | Learning consistency |
| **WIS** | Pattern recognition + reflection |
| **VIT** | Fatigue stability |

→ Stats increase in **micro-increments** (e.g. +0.1) to sustain momentum.

---

### 3. Dopamine Architecture (Progression Loop)

- **Dopamine rewards progress**, not outcomes  
- **Micro-increments** create constant feedback  
- **Visible tracking** reinforces behavior  
- **Self-propelling loop** = sustainable motivation

> Games have used this for decades. Now reality can.

---

### 4. Leveling System (Non-Medical)

- **Level = aggregate of micro-improvements**  
- **Level-up = milestone in habit stability**  
- No health claims — purely behavioral feedback

---

### 5. Quest System (Behavioral Goals)

AI generates **micro-quests**:

- “Walk 300m”  
- “Drink water once now”  
- “Focus 5 minutes”  
- “Stretch 30 seconds”  
- “Write 1 sentence”

→ Micro-quests → micro-wins → macro-change.

---

### 6. Advancement Tier (Lifestyle Tiering)

Descriptive tiers of daily pattern quality:

| Tier | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | Chaotic |
| 2 | Semi-stable |
| 3 | Stable |
| 4 | Disciplined |
| 5 | Optimized |

→ Not clinical. Just narrative scaffolding.

## 🧪 Applications

- **Gamified self-improvement**  
- **Mental health scaffolding (non-medical)**  
- **AI-human co-living systems**  
- **Habit tracking with narrative feedback**  
- **Wearable-integrated RPGs**
